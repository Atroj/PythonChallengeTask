To run you need:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py runserver

I did simple version according to the instruction.
This version has many things to improve:
- Writing unit tests
- Split api_service to few small classes for tests
- Error handling 
- Saparate backend and frontend(for example use react on frontend side)
- Use docker, CI, CD.
- ...
